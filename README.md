üé• **YouTube Tutorial Code Library**

This repository serves as a centralized collection of code and notes derived from various YouTube tutorials covering a specific technology stack or topic (e.g., Python, Web Development, Cloud Infrastructure, etc.).

It is designed to help me (and potentially others) revisit, run, and modify the examples from the tutorials efficiently.

üóÇ **Folder Structure**

The repository is organized by specific tutorial projects. Each folder represents a complete, self-contained project or major section from a single YouTube tutorial.
To find a specific tutorial's code, look for a folder with a descriptive name.

‚öôÔ∏è **Prerequisites and Setup**
Before running any of the projects, ensure you have the following installed (these are generic examples, adjust as needed):
Python: Version 3.10+
Virtual Environments: Use venv or conda for isolation.
Node.js & npm/yarn: For any JavaScript-based tutorials.

**Running a Project Example**
1. Navigate to the project folder: cd fastapi-todo-app

2. Install dependencies (check for a requirements.txt or package.json): pip install -r requirements.txt

Follow the project-specific instructions (usually contained in a smaller project-readme.md inside the folder) to run the application.
